      <h2>Overview of Interpreter</h2>
      <p>As you all know, Brainfuck (censored as Brainf**k or Brainf*** sometimes) was a programming language created by Urban MÃ¼ller as a programming language that can be run on the smallest interpreter.</p>
      <p>It is composed of memory, which is an array of 30000 bytes, which includes a byte pointer, pointing to one of the 30000 bytes (note that they are all initially set to 0).</p>
      <p>There are 8 commands, >; <; +; -; .; ,; [; and ] which can be used to manipulate with the 30000-byte array.</p>
      <p>Enjoy this Brainf*** interpreter!</p>
